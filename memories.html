                            <div class="card">
                                <div class="card-body">
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Our daughter Crystal was born 14 months after her older brother 
                                        Austin. She had a traumatic birth. Transported from the hospital in Natick, 
                                        to Children's Hospital, Boston, because she had a blood infection.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Crystal was born with hereditary asplenia syndrome, 
                                        which involves not only facial cranial problems, but cardiac and no spleen, 
                                        so infections are more common.<br>
                                        She had two cardiac conditions which were repaired before age, she was on life-support 
                                        three times before age 6, she had brain infection and encephalitis and pneumococcal meningitis 
                                        before 9.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Crystal was always our die hard. We did mountain bikes through the woods, 
                                        I don't think Crystal even saw the woods, she just plummeted through. She had stamina she always said 
                                        and because of that she wanted her independence.<br>
                                        At the age of 16, she took on the saving name of Christ and the window of opportunity opened for her, 
                                        visible hand of God, she passed in exam to become a Christadelphian in our fellowship. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">She had her ups and downs, as all human nature does. She endured, she was a people person. 
                                        I'll tell you she was a bag lady too. She loved different bags and we're not gonna talk about coffee mugs!</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><em>My daughter you knew trials and tribulations as a student of Christ.</em> 
                                        Thankfully all was well the last months of her life was of thriving. She is awaiting a calling from Christ. 
                                        I pray in good stead. <br><em>"Come forth and enter into my kingdom."</em>

Crystal was kind and full of life, always offering to help—whether she was picking peas from our garden or watching out for her little brother, Hunter, as they snuck over to the garage. Her love for animals was unparalleled, especially the way she cared for her pot-bellied pig, treating it as lovingly as a dog.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Despite facing many medical challenges growing up, she never let them weigh her down. Crystal embraced life with enthusiasm and courage—a vibrant child whose spirit will never be forgotten. Rest in peace, Crystal—you will be missed.</p>

                                        for me you should not weep<br>
                                        I have no pain or troubled thoughts
                                        for I am just asleep<br>
                                        The living thinking me that was,
                                        is now forever still<br>
                                        And life goes on without me now,
                                        as time forever will.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">If your heart is heavy now
                                        because I’ve gone away<br>
                                        Dwell not long upon it, friend,
                                        for none of us can stay.</p>

                                        as time went rushing by,<br>
                                        I found some time to hesitate,
                                        to laugh, to love, to cry.<br>
                                        Matters it now if time began,
                                        if time will ever cease?<br>
                                        I was here, I used it all,
                                        and now I am at peace.</p>
